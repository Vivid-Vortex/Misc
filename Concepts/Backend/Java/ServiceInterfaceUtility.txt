In general why do we create an interface of a service class in springboot and then we implement that interface in another implementation service class. what is the purpose of the using extra interface in thsi case?

	Using interfaces in Spring Boot service classes follows the principle of abstraction and modularity, which are fundamental concepts in software engineering and design. There are several reasons why this approach is commonly used:

	Eagle eye view without folding the methods using IDE features: In generaal if the class is very huge, sometimes it's very difficult to grasp the overall
	funcaionality of the entire class without us folding all the methods and then look those method one by one. So instead of folding the method and scrolling over the class, we can directly look into the intreace this implementation class is implementing.
	
	Abstraction: Interfaces provide a way to define a contract for what methods a service should have without specifying how those methods are implemented. This allows for separation of concerns, as the interface defines what the service should do, while the implementation focuses on how it does it. This abstraction makes the code more maintainable and easier to understand, as it hides unnecessary details.
	
	Loose coupling:
		Dependency Injection (DI): Spring Boot leverages dependency injection extensively for managing dependencies between different components of an application. By defining service classes as interfaces and injecting them where needed, Spring Boot allows for loose coupling between components. This makes it easier to swap implementations or mock dependencies for testing purposes, as you can inject different implementations of the same interface without changing the consuming code.

	Polymorphism and Flexibility: Interfaces enable polymorphism, allowing you to treat different implementations of the same interface interchangeably. This means you can write code that depends on the interface rather than a specific implementation, which increases flexibility and makes your code more adaptable to changes in requirements.

	Encapsulation: Interfaces provide a level of encapsulation by defining a boundary between different components of an application. This helps to organize and structure the codebase, making it easier to manage and maintain over time.
	
	Testing: Interfaces make it easier to test components in isolation by allowing you to mock dependencies. By defining service dependencies as interfaces, you can create mock implementations of those interfaces for unit testing, which helps to isolate the code under test and make tests more focused and reliable.


how can we leverage this concept for testing purpose. could you please explain in an elaborative way by giving few code examples?

	Let's consider a simple example where we have a service interface called UserService and two implementations: UserServiceImpl and MockUserServiceImpl. We'll use Mockito to create mock implementations for testing purposes.

	First, let's define the UserService interface:

	public interface UserService {
			User getUserById(Long userId);
			void saveUser(User user);
			// Other methods as needed
	}
	Now, let's implement the UserServiceImpl class:

	@Service
	public class UserServiceImpl implements UserService {
			private UserRepository userRepository;

			@Autowired
			public UserServiceImpl(UserRepository userRepository) {
					this.userRepository = userRepository;
			}

			@Override
			public User getUserById(Long userId) {
					return userRepository.findById(userId).orElse(null);
			}

			@Override
			public void saveUser(User user) {
					userRepository.save(user);
			}
	}

	And let's say we want to write tests for a service or controller that depends on UserService. We can create a mock implementation of UserService for testing purposes:

	import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;

	public class MockUserServiceImpl implements UserService {
			@Override
			public User getUserById(Long userId) {
					// Mock implementation for testing
					User user = new User();
					user.setId(userId);
					user.setUsername("mockUser");
					return user;
			}

			@Override
			public void saveUser(User user) {
					// Do nothing for testing purposes
			}
	}

	Now, let's see how we can use this mock implementation in a test:

	import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

	import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
	import static org.mockito.Mockito.mock;
	import static org.mockito.Mockito.when;

	public class MyServiceTest {

			@Test
			public void testUserService() {
					// Create mock implementation
					UserService userServiceMock = new MockUserServiceImpl();

					// Create an instance of the class that depends on UserService
					MyClassUnderTest myClassUnderTest = new MyClassUnderTest(userServiceMock);

					// Test the functionality
					User user = myClassUnderTest.getUserById(123L);

					// Assert the result
					assertEquals("mockUser", user.getUsername());
			}
	}
	In this test, we're creating an instance of MyClassUnderTest, which depends on UserService. Instead of using the real implementation of UserService, we're injecting a mock implementation (MockUserServiceImpl). This allows us to isolate the behavior of MyClassUnderTest and focus solely on testing its functionality without relying on external dependencies.
