Running Visual Studio Code (VS Code) in portable mode allows you to use it without the need for installation, making it easy to carry and use on different machines. Here are the steps to run VS Code in portable mode:

1. **Download VS Code:**
   - Visit the [VS Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and download the "ZIP" archive for your operating system.

2. **Extract the ZIP Archive:**
   - Extract the contents of the ZIP archive to a folder of your choice. This folder will be your portable VS Code installation.

3. **Create a Data Folder:**
   - Inside the folder where you extracted the ZIP archive, create a new folder named `data`. This folder will be used to store user data and configurations.

4. **Modify User Data Path:**
   - Open the `settings.json` file inside the `data` folder. If it doesn't exist, create it.
   - Add the following line to the `settings.json` file:
     ```json
     {
       "userDataPath": "./data"
     }
     ```
   - Save the file.

5. **Run VS Code:**
   - Navigate to the main folder where you extracted the ZIP archive.
   - Look for the executable file. On Windows, it's typically `Code.exe`, on macOS, it's `Code`, and on Linux, it might be `code` or `code-insiders`.
   - Double-click on the executable file to launch VS Code in portable mode.

6. **Optional: Create a Shortcut:**
   - If you want to create a shortcut for easier access, you can do so by creating a shortcut to the executable file.

Running VS Code in portable mode ensures that all the configurations and extensions are contained within the folder where you extracted the ZIP archive. This makes it easy to carry and use on different machines without affecting the system's settings.

Keep in mind that while this method allows you to run VS Code without a traditional installation, you won't get automatic updates. You'll need to manually download and replace the extracted files when new versions are released.
