First and foremost:
1. Install Windows termial if you're using windows 10 or above.
2. Install and setup WSL2
3. Install vim
4. Install Posh
	winget install JanDeDobbeleer.OhMyPosh -s winget
5. Install powertoys
6. Install git

Access Wsl files:
1. Use Linux icon on the Windows Nav bar.
2. Run '\\wsl$\' cmd directly under windows run (windows + r) option
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bind all the localhost connections from wsl to windows localhost:
Run below command:

export DISPLAY=$(awk '/nameserver / {print $2; exit}' /etc/resolv.conf 2>/dev/null):0

Explanation:
Accessing via localhost: If you prefer to use localhost instead of the IP address, you can utilize a feature called "localhost forwarding" in WSL 2. This feature allows you to access services running in WSL 2 via localhost on Windows. To enable localhost forwarding, add the following line to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile file in WSL:

After adding this line, restart your WSL 2 instance or source the file (e.g., source ~/.bashrc). This will make services running in WSL 2 available via localhost on your Windows system.

This way you can run anythign on wsl linux and access it via localhost on windows directly, without you have to change the conf files
of those applications one by one.
